00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,080
compartment with a sound vent on it that
 

141
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,170
compartment with a sound vent on it that
puts out a sound impulse to warn the

142
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,180
puts out a sound impulse to warn the
 

143
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,369
puts out a sound impulse to warn the
cattle when they're entering an area

144
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:58,379
cattle when they're entering an area
 

145
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,589
cattle when they're entering an area
that they should not be in and then

146
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
that they should not be in and then
 

147
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,570
that they should not be in and then
there's an electrical impulse that comes

148
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:02,580
there's an electrical impulse that comes
 

149
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,750
there's an electrical impulse that comes
up through the chain and that is what

150
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
up through the chain and that is what
 

151
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,430
up through the chain and that is what
deters them further if the sound doesn't

152
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
deters them further if the sound doesn't
 

153

deters them further if the sound doesn't
there's a training protocol that we go

154
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:09,239
there's a training protocol that we go
 

155
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,550
there's a training protocol that we go
through and they learn it pretty quickly

156
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
through and they learn it pretty quickly
 

157
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,890
through and they learn it pretty quickly
that the sound means don't go there and

158
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:12,900
that the sound means don't go there and
 

159
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,830
that the sound means don't go there and
so they quit going in there and it just

160
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
so they quit going in there and it just
 

161
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,270
so they quit going in there and it just
hangs around their neck

162
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
hangs around their neck
 

163

179
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,690
where he wants them to be so the collars
that we're using utilize AM radio and

180
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:38,700
that we're using utilize AM radio and
 

181
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,030
that we're using utilize AM radio and
GPS and we're able to pre-load the

collars with our grazing parameters and
 

185
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,490
collars with our grazing parameters and
so the collars can go offline from the

186
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:46,500
so the collars can go offline from the
 

187
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,869
so the collars can go offline from the

through virtual fencing we're able to

192
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:53,159
through virtual fencing we're able to
 

193
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,250
through virtual fencing we're able to
focus just on our perimeter fence and

194
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,260
focus just on our perimeter fence and
 

195
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,170
focus just on our perimeter fence and
then not worry about the interior as

196
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,180
then not worry about the interior as
 

197
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,390
then not worry about the interior as
much and we use those collars to

198
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,400
much and we use those collars to
 

199
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,430
much and we use those collars to
actually do the rotations that we have

200
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,440
actually do the rotations that we have
 

201
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,550
actually do the rotations that we have
planned and so using the computer
